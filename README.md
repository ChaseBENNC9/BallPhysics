# Ball Physics Game

## Project Description
Developed with Unreal Engine 5
This project will be my first attempt at developing with the unreal engine. With the purpose of teaching myself the basics of blueprints.
the gameplay involves the user controlling a ball by rolling it around with the goal of reaching the end of each level. Several objects will be placed throughout these levels to help or prevent the player from reaching the end.

## Roadmap
I intend to give the game 5 main levels and possibly a couple hidden levels. and add different objects into each level to add to more interesting gameplay,
### Objects
- [x] **Platform:** The User can knock these over to form a bridge between two areas
- [x] **Jump Pad:** The user can use these to boost to a higher area
- [x] **Checkpoint** The User can respawn here when needed after they have been activated
- [ ] **Switch** This can change something in the level such as activate a moving platform or unlock a hidden area.
- [ ] **Elevator / Moving Platform** These will move to a different area once activated with a switch
- [ ] **Hazard** This will be an obstacle that will result in failure if touched by the player
- [x] **Spinner** This is a spinning platform where the player needs to use timing and precision to navigate over.
### Levels
- [x] Level 1 - Basic introduction to mechanics. Main obstacle is the standard platform and jump pads
- [x] Level 2 - Introduces switches and spinners. Contains many moving platforms that the player must activate first with switches.
- [ ] Level 3 - Will introduce a more difficult navigation with thinner platforms. Will also contain a secret exit.
- [ ] Level 4 - Introduces hazards and more physics based objects.
- [ ] Level 5 - Will Combine many of the previously introduced mechanics

#### Secret Levels
Secret Levels can be unlocked by finding a secret path in the main levels. they will have some unique features
